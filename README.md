LinerNotes
----------
Integrates with iTunes to display album artwork, engineer/performance credits, lyrics and meta data about the music playing.


Since listening to music digitally became the norm, the ability to experience an "Album" has been diminished. A few artists have tried to deliver a multimedia experience via DVDs or media CDs but that misses the common use case: a fan listening to the music on their computer.

The idea of Liner Notes is to allow you to immerse yourself in the visual side of music again. I envision a music explorer of sorts, where the listener can view in-depth information about the current artist. During the Music Hack Day, I made some decent progress, but it's no where near where it needs to be. If you have experience in front-end design or just want to hack on MacRuby/Cocoa - get in touch! I plan on pushing it forward.
